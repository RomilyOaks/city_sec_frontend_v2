## [Unreleased] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- Documentation: Added file headers and concise JSDoc across many components and pages (phase 1).
  - Key files: `src/pages/admin/RolesPermisosPage.jsx`, `src/pages/admin/AdminUsuariosPage.jsx`, `src/components/ChangePasswordModal.jsx`, `src/components/NovedadDetalleModal.jsx`, `src/components/MapaIncidentes.jsx`, `src/components/common/ThemeToggle.jsx`, `src/components/common/ThemeApplier.jsx`, `src/routes/ProtectedRoute.jsx`, `src/routes/AppRouter.jsx`, `src/layouts/AppShell.jsx`, `src/pages/auth/LoginPage.jsx`, `src/pages/auth/SignupPage.jsx`, `src/pages/personal/PersonalPage.jsx`, `src/pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.jsx`, `src/pages/NotFoundPage.jsx`, and multiple services in `src/services/`.

### Changed

- Consolidated duplicated JSDoc blocks (ThemeToggle, ThemeApplier, RolesPermisosPage, AppRouter, ProtectedRoute, NovedadesPage `fetchCatalogos`, and others).
- Applied non-invasive runtime fixes: avoided "setState on unmounted component" in `RolesPermisosPage.jsx` (added mounted ref guards and deferred state updates where appropriate).
- Ran ESLint and fixed minor issues; remaining warnings are documented below.

### Notes

- Lint: ESLint run shows 8 warnings (no errors). Warnings include incompatible-library notice for `react-hook-form`'s `watch()`, missing hook deps in some pages, and unused `eslint-disable` directives in `src/services/api.js` and `src/services/authService.js`.
- Branch: `docs/documentation-phase1` (ready to open PR for review).

### Suggested review points for the PR

- Verify the JSDoc content for accuracy and style preferences (we consolidated verbose blocks into concise component-level JSDoc).
- Confirm the `RolesPermisosPage` guard fix meets expectations for async behavior.
- Check the remaining ESLint warnings and decide which should be addressed now vs later.
